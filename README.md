# bezier_latex

A work in progress, bezier_latex is intended to be a javascript application that allows a user to create a bezier curve with n control points
in 2d cartesian space and export to latex code. 

To try this out, clone this repository...

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jawardell/bezier_latex
```

...then move into the directory and open up the `index.html` page.

```shell
cd bezier_latex
open index.html
```
